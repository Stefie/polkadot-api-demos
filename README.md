## Work in progress
Examples of how to use the [Polkadot{js} API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api), which supports both [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) chains.

If you want to know more about the Substrate Framework, please visit the [Developer Hub](https://substrate.readme.io/docs)


## Installation:

- run `git clone https://github.com/Stefie/polkadot-js--api-demos/master` in the terminal OR [Download a ZIP](https://github.com/Stefie/polkadot-js--api-demos/archive/master.zip)

- run `yarn install`

- running `yarn run vanilla-promise`, will start up the  examples that can be found in `packages/vanilla-js-promise`. It should open a new browser window on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

- running `yarn run vanilla-rx`, will start up the examples that can be found in `packages/vanilla-js-rx`. It should open a new browser window on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Now you can start editing the examples inside the `packages`folder. All packages have Hot Module Replacement enabled so the browser window should automatically reload when you edit and save a file.
